# Nakama Pin Shopify Theme

This is a custom made shopify theme for my online store: https://www.nakamapin.com

I forked the Dawn theme from Shopify with the latest features, and customized it with styling and added components that fits the business's motif. It was developed with Shopify Liquid templating language, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

The website is a progressive web app utilizing the idea of mobile first development since +95% of our customers are browsing through their phone. Includes UI feedback for adding to and removing from cart. 

You can find more information about the Dawn theme in Dawn.md
