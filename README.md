# Nakama Pin Shopify Theme

This is a custom made shopify theme for https://www.nakamapin.com

I forked the Dawn theme from Shopify with the latest features, and customized it with styling and added components that fits the business's motif. It was developed with Shopify Liquid templating language, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

The website is a progressive web app utilizing the idea of mobile first development since +95% of our customers are browsing through their phone. Includes responsive UI feedback for adding to cart and removing from cart. 

All the theme management was done with the latest Shopify dev tool: Shopify CLI

You can find more information about the Dawn theme in Dawn.md
